/**
 * The contract between the relay and a transport.
 *
 * A transport has two halves.
 *
 * Server half (`Transport`, below): listens for peers and hands each one to the
 * relay as a `Connection`. It owns everything wire-specific: framing,
 * encryption, backpressure, peer identity.
 *
 * Client half (`TransportClient`, below): dials a relay at an address and
 * exchanges text frames. Agents and the test client use it, so they do not
 * care which transport reaches the relay.
 *
 * Both halves move whole text frames. A frame is one NIP-01 message
 * (`["EVENT", ...]`, `["REQ", ...]`, ...) as a JSON string; the relay parses it.
 * Identity is not a transport concern: Nostr identity comes from NIP-42 on top
 * of whatever the transport provides. A transport may derive its own wire key
 * from `relay.secretKey` (the swarm transport does), but never signs events.
 *
 * See docs/transports.md for a walkthrough.
