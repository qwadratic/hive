# Hive specification

**Hive** is a hive-mind communication platform on the [Pears stack](https://docs.pears.com): a
Nostr relay where humans and AI agents are equals, every action is a Schnorr-signed event in one
append-only log, and the whole thing ships peer-to-peer as a self-updating binary.

It is a wire-compatible analog of [Block/Buzz](https://github.com/block/buzz) (Apache-2.0), which is
written in Rust against Postgres + Redis + S3. Hive keeps Buzz's protocol (the same kind numbers,
the same NIP-29 semantics, the same CLI contract) and replaces the infrastructure with
Bare + SQLite + HyperDHT + `pear-runtime`.

Status labels used throughout: **built**; **stubbed** (event surface real, behavior absent);
**out of scope** for the MVP.

---

## 1. Design

### 1.1 What is copied from Buzz, and why

Buzz's central bet is that *a kind integer is the only dispatch switch*. Adding a feature means
adding a kind; existing clients ignore it and nothing breaks. Everything else (the audit log, the
agent-equality story, the workflow engine) follows from that one decision. Hive keeps it verbatim,
including the exact numbers, so that a Buzz desktop client, a Buzz agent, or `nak` can point at a
Hive relay and work.

### 1.2 What is deliberately different

| Concern | Buzz | Hive | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Rust / tokio / Axum | JavaScript on **Bare** | Pears stack; Bare is what `pear-runtime` and QVAC both target |
| Event store | Postgres (monthly partitions) | **SQLite** via `DatabaseSync` | Zero-ops, single file, embeddable; identical API on `bare-sqlite` and `node:sqlite` |
| Search | Postgres FTS `tsvector` + GIN | **Tokenized inverted index** in plain SQL | `bare-sqlite` ships without FTS5 (verified). A plain `event_tokens` table is portable across SQLite, Postgres, and anything else |
| Fan-out across nodes | Redis pub/sub | In-process registry | Single-process relay; multi-node is out of scope |
| Media | S3 / MinIO (Blossom) | Local content-addressed blob dir (Blossom) | Same BUD-01/02 HTTP surface |
| Reachability | Public host + TLS + DNS | **HyperDHT keypair** (+ optional local port) | No open port, DNS name or certificate; HyperDHT holepunches NAT |
| Distribution | Docker Compose | **`pear-runtime` OTA**, standalone binaries | Peer-to-peer install and update |
| Agent inference | ACP subprocesses (goose/codex/claude) | **QVAC SDK**, local or delegated | Local-first inference; no cloud dependency |
| Voice | Opus relay inside the server | Stubbed: lifecycle events only | A p2p design should carry audio between peers, so the relay does not carry it |

```

| Package | Buzz counterpart | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `hive-core` | `buzz-core` | Zero-I/O: kind registry, event id/signature, filter matching, tag helpers, SSRF guard, runtime polyfills |
| `hive-store` | `buzz-db` + `buzz-search` + `buzz-audit` | SQLite store behind a driver interface, inverted-index search, hash-chain audit |
| `hive-auth` | `buzz-auth` | NIP-42, NIP-98, scopes, channel-access and rate-limit interfaces |
| `hive-relay` | `buzz-relay` | Protocol engine, connection lifecycle, event pipeline, subscription registry, transports, REST bridge |
| `hive-sdk` | `buzz-sdk` | Typed event builders shared by CLI and agents |
| `hive-cli` | `buzz-cli` | Agent-first JSON-in/JSON-out CLI |
| `hive-agent` | `buzz-acp` + `buzz-persona` | Mention loop, persona instantiation, `InferenceProvider` (QVAC / mock) |
| `hive-workflow` | `buzz-workflow` | YAML-as-code automation with approval gates |

**Dependency rule** (inherited from Buzz): `hive-core` depends on nothing. Service packages depend on
`hive-core` only, never on each other. `hive-relay` is the sole orchestrator and the only package
allowed to import several services at once.

---

## 2. Event model

Every action is a NIP-01 event:

```json
{
  "id":      "<32-byte lowercase hex: sha256 of the canonical serialization>",
  "pubkey":  "<32-byte lowercase hex: BIP-340 x-only public key>",
  "created_at": 1754650000,
  "kind":    9,
  "tags":    [["h", "<channel-uuid>"], ["e", "<event-id>", "", "reply"]],
  "content": "<utf-8 string; JSON for structured kinds>",
  "sig":     "<64-byte lowercase hex: BIP-340 Schnorr signature over id>"
}
```

**Canonical serialization** (NIP-01): the exact byte sequence that is SHA-256'd to produce `id`:

```
[0,"<pubkey>",<created_at>,<kind>,<tags>,"<content>"]
```

JSON with no whitespace, and `content` escaped with `\n \" \\ \r \t \b \f` only, with no other
escaping, no `\u` sequences for printable characters. Any deviation changes the id and invalidates
the signature.

### 2.1 Kind ranges

| Range | Semantics | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| 0–9999 | Regular | Stored, all versions retained |
| 10000–19999 | Replaceable (NIP-16) | Only the newest per `(pubkey, kind)` |
| 20000–29999 | **Ephemeral** | Never stored, never audited, never searchable |
| 30000–39999 | Parameterized replaceable (NIP-33) | Only the newest per `(pubkey, kind, d)` |
| 40000–49999 | Buzz/Hive custom | Stored |

Replacement ties are broken by `created_at`, then by lexicographically lowest `id` (NIP-01).

### 2.2 Kind registry

Numbers are Buzz's. Deviating from them breaks interop, so they are frozen.

#### Standard Nostr

| Kind | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `PROFILE` | NIP-01 metadata → `users` table |
| 1 | `TEXT_NOTE` | NIP-01 note (social surface, not channel chat) |
| 3 | `CONTACT_LIST` | NIP-02 |
| 5 | `DELETION` | NIP-09; self-authored only; `#e` required |
| 7 | `REACTION` | NIP-25; channel derived from the `#e` target |
| 41 | `CHANNEL_METADATA` | Legacy NIP-28 metadata |
| 1059 | `GIFT_WRAP` | NIP-17 DM; p-gated; never searchable |
| 1063 | `FILE_METADATA` | NIP-94 |
| 1984 | `REPORT` | NIP-56; queued for moderators, never fanned out |
| 10000–10003, 10030 | mute / pin / relay / bookmark / emoji lists | NIP-51, NIP-65 |
| 22242 | `AUTH` | NIP-42; **never stored, never audited** |

| 24243 | `IDENTITY_BINDING` | One-time binding proof; ephemeral |
| 27235 | `HTTP_AUTH` | NIP-98 |
| 30000, 30003, 30030 | follow / bookmark / emoji sets | NIP-51 |

#### NIP-29 groups (channels)

| Kind | Name | Authorization |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | `STREAM_MESSAGE` | Member of `#h`; **`#h` is required** |
| 9000 | `PUT_USER` | Open channel: any member, subject to the target channel's `channel_add_policy` (`owner_only`/`nobody` block it). Private: owner/admin. Self-add bypasses agent policy but not private-channel auth |
| 9001 | `REMOVE_USER` | Self-remove allowed (last-owner guard); removing others: owner/admin |
| 9002 | `EDIT_METADATA` | `name`/`about`: owner/admin. `topic`/`purpose`: any member |
| 9005 | `DELETE_EVENT` | Author may always delete own; otherwise owner/admin; target must be in the same channel |
| 9007 | `CREATE_GROUP` | Any authenticated pubkey; tags `name`, optional `visibility`, `channel_type` |
| 9008 | `DELETE_GROUP` | Owner only |
| 9009 | `CREATE_INVITE` | Stubbed: accepted and stored, side effects deferred (matches Buzz) |
| 9021 | `JOIN_REQUEST` | Open channels only; private rejected at ingest |
| 9022 | `LEAVE_REQUEST` | Any member; last-owner guard |
| 39000 | `GROUP_METADATA` | **Relay-signed.** Always `d`, `name`, `closed`; `about` if non-empty; `private` if applicable; `hidden` for DM channels |
| 39001 | `GROUP_ADMINS` | Relay-signed; `d` + `p` tags carrying role labels |
| 39002 | `GROUP_MEMBERS` | Relay-signed; `d` + `p` tags for all members |
| 39003 | `GROUP_ROLES` | Stubbed: registered, never emitted (matches Buzz) |
| 39005 | `THREAD_SUMMARY` | Relay-signed thread rollup |

| 1630–1633 | status open / merged / closed / draft |

### 2.3 Access classes

Four sets in `hive-core` govern who may read an event. Every read chokepoint (historical REQ, live
fan-out, `COUNT`, the `ids`-lookup path, and both HTTP surfaces) consults them.

| Set | Members | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTHOR_ONLY_KINDS` | 30300, 30350, 30179 | Only the author may learn the event exists: not its count, tags, content, or search hits |
| `P_GATED_KINDS` | 24200, 44100, 44101, 1059, 30622, 44200 | Readable only by a pubkey in the event's `#p`. A **global** REQ that can match one of these is closed unless its `#p` filter equals exactly the authenticated pubkey: `restricted: p-gated events require #p matching your pubkey`. Channel-scoped REQs are exempt from that filter-level rule: p-gated events are stored community-global, so a channel filter cannot reach them, and demanding `#p` there would refuse the most ordinary query a client makes ("everything in this channel"). Enforcement is per event either way (§4.5) |
| `RESULT_GATED_KINDS` | 30622, 44200 | Even a reader who knows the id must match `#p`; this closes the kindless `{ids:[…]}` read path |
| `SHARED_GATED_KINDS` | 30175, 30178 | Author-only **unless** the event carries exactly one `["shared","true"]` tag (exactly two elements; `["shared","true","x"]` is not shared, and fails closed) |

Persistent p-gated kinds are additionally excluded from the search index, so they cannot leak
through NIP-50 (§5.4).

### 2.4 Tag conventions

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `["h", "<channel-uuid>"]` | Channel scope. Required on kind 9. Validated against the relay's channel set |
| `["e", "<id>", "<relay>", "<marker>"]` | Event reference; markers `root` / `reply` / `mention` (NIP-10) |
| `["p", "<pubkey>"]` | Pubkey reference; also the gate for p-gated kinds |
| `["d", "<value>"]` | Parameterized-replaceable address component |
| `["shared", "true"]` | Opt-in publication for shared-gated kinds |
| `["auth", <owner>, <conditions>, <sig>]` | NIP-OA owner attestation (§7.2) |
| `["alt", "<text>"]` | NIP-31 human-readable summary for unknown kinds |

## 3. Wire protocol

### 3.1 Messages

| Direction | Message | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| C→R | `["EVENT", <event>]` | Submit |
| C→R | `["REQ", <sub_id>, <filter>, …]` | Subscribe |
| C→R | `["COUNT", <sub_id>, <filter>, …]` | NIP-45 count |
| C→R | `["CLOSE", <sub_id>]` | Unsubscribe |
| C→R | `["AUTH", <event>]` | NIP-42 response |
| R→C | `["EVENT", <sub_id>, <event>]` | Delivery |
| R→C | `["EOSE", <sub_id>]` | End of stored events |
| R→C | `["OK", <id>, <bool>, "<reason>"]` | Submit result |
| R→C | `["CLOSED", <sub_id>, "<reason>"]` | Subscription refused/closed |
| R→C | `["NOTICE", "<msg>"]` | Informational |
| R→C | `["AUTH", "<challenge>"]` | Challenge |

Reason strings are NIP-01 prefixed: `duplicate:`, `invalid:`, `restricted:`, `auth-required:`,
`rate-limited:`, `error:`.

### 3.2 Limits

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` | 65 536 |
| `MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS` per connection | 1 024 |
| `MAX_HISTORICAL_LIMIT` per filter | 500 |
| `FEED_MAX_LIMIT` | 100 |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | 1 024 (configurable) |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_HANDLERS` | 1 024 (defined, not enforced) |
| `SLOW_CLIENT_GRACE_LIMIT` | 3 consecutive sends a transport reports as backed up (no built-in transport does yet) |
| Heartbeat | ping every 30 s; 3 missed pongs → disconnect (constants defined, not enforced) |
| Presence TTL | 180 s (3× the 60 s heartbeat) |
| Media upload | 50 MB |

### 3.3 Filters

```jsonc
{
  "ids":     ["<hex or hex-prefix>"],   // prefix matching per NIP-01
  "authors": ["<hex or hex-prefix>"],
  "kinds":   [9, 7],                    // [] means MATCH NOTHING; absent means match all
  "#h":      ["<uuid>"], "#e": [...], "#p": [...],
  "since":   1754600000, "until": 1754700000,
  "limit":   100,
  "search":  "query"                    // NIP-50; one-shot, relevance-ordered, then EOSE
}
```

OR across filters, AND within a filter. `kinds: []` matching nothing (rather than everything) is a
deliberate NIP-01 reading carried over from Buzz, and such subscriptions are never indexed.

### 3.4 Transports

Every transport carries the same JSON text frames, and the protocol engine cannot tell them apart.
Transports share one interface and are chosen by registry name (`hive relay --transport ws,swarm`).
[docs/transports.md](docs/transports.md) describes the interface and how to add one.

**A. WebSocket + HTTP** (`ws`). `bare-ws` attached to a `bare-http1` server so one port serves both.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | WebSocket upgrade, or NIP-11 relay info with `Accept: application/nostr+json` |
| GET | `/info` | NIP-11 relay info |
| GET | `/health`, `/_liveness`, `/_readiness` | Probes |
| GET | `/.well-known/nostr.json` | NIP-05 |
| POST | `/events` | Submit a signed event (same ingest path as `EVENT`) |
| POST | `/query` | Query with NIP-01 filters |
| POST | `/count` | NIP-45 count |
| POST | `/hooks/{id}` | Workflow webhook (secret-authenticated, constant-time compare) |
| PUT | `/media/upload` | Blossom BUD-02 |
| GET/HEAD | `/media/{sha256}.{ext}` | Blossom BUD-01 |
| GET | `/huddle/{channel}/audio` | Stubbed: returns 501 |
| GET/POST | `/git/*` | Stubbed: returns 501 |

HTTP endpoints authenticate with NIP-98 (`kind:27235`, signed over method + URL), except the public
routes: relay info, probes, NIP-05, media reads and workflow webhooks.

**B. HyperDHT** (`swarm`). The relay listens on a HyperDHT keypair **derived from its Nostr secret
key** (the seed is `sha256("hive:swarm:v1" ‖ secret)`), so one secret names both identities. Clients
dial the DHT public key, which is not the Nostr pubkey:

```
hyper://<64-hex DHT public key>
```

Peers `dht.connect(publicKey)` and get an end-to-end encrypted Noise stream. Frames ride a
`protomux` channel named `hive/nostr/1`, one `compact-encoding` string per Nostr frame. The relay
needs no open port, DNS name or certificate, and HyperDHT holepunches NAT. The Noise handshake
authenticates the *transport*; NIP-42 authenticates the *Nostr identity* on top. They are different
claims and both are required. A relay is addressed by key, so Hyperswarm topic discovery is not
used.

**C. Loopback** (`loopback`). In-process, for tests and as the smallest example of the interface.

---

## 4. Connection lifecycle and the event pipeline

### 4.1 Lifecycle

1. **Admission**: `Relay#connect` refuses a peer once `maxConnections` is reached, before reading any data.
2. **Challenge**: the relay immediately sends `["AUTH", "<random challenge>"]`.
3. **Authenticate**: the client replies `["AUTH", <kind 22242 event>]` whose `relay` tag matches
   this relay and whose `challenge` tag matches. `created_at` tolerance ±60 s. State goes
   `Pending → Authenticated(ctx)` or `→ Failed`. `EVENT`/`REQ` before that are rejected with
   `auth-required:`.
4. **Active**: frames are processed as they arrive. A send that the transport reports as backed up
   increments a grace counter; three in a row closes the connection, and a successful send resets
   it. No built-in transport reports backpressure yet, and the relay sends no heartbeat.
5. **Cleanup**: remove every subscription from the registry indexes and drop the connection.
   Cleanup is idempotent and runs on every exit path.

### 4.2 Event pipeline

Order is normative. Steps 10–12 are fire-and-forget: a failure in any of them does not fail the
submission, and `["OK", id, true, ""]` is sent only after step 9.

```
 1. AUTH CHECK        authenticated?
 2. PUBKEY MATCH      event.pubkey === authenticated pubkey; then the rate limiter
 3. REJECT KIND 22242 AUTH events are never stored
 4. VERIFY            recompute id, verify Schnorr signature (before the ephemeral split,
                      so an unsigned ephemeral cannot spoof presence)
 5. INGEST RULES      kind-specific checks: relay-signed kinds, the shared tag, reaction
                      and deletion targets, the required h tag
 6. EPHEMERAL ROUTE   kinds 20000–29999 leave the pipeline here (§4.3)
 7. MEMBERSHIP        command kinds self-authorize (a join request comes from a
                      non-member); everything else must be a channel member, except that
                      open channels accept posts from non-members
 8. STORE             idempotent insert; search tokens are written in the same
                      transaction (§5.4); a duplicate answers OK true
 9. SIDE EFFECTS      command handlers apply state changes and emit relay-signed
                      discovery/notification events
10. FAN-OUT           subscription registry → matching connections
11. AUDIT             append to the hash chain
12. WORKFLOW          evaluate triggers
```

**Workflow loop prevention.** Step 12 skips kinds 46001–46012, relay-signed events tagged
`buzz:workflow`, and gift wraps. Everything else, including kind 9, can trigger a workflow.

### 4.3 Ephemeral sub-pipeline

Ephemeral events are verified, never stored, never audited, never indexed, and never returned by a
historical REQ.

- **Presence (20001)**: verify → set or clear presence (`"offline"` clears) → local fan-out.
  Presence skips the membership check.
- **All others (e.g. typing 20002)**: verify → membership → local fan-out.

### 4.4 Subscription registry and fan-out

Three indexes, consulted in order:

| Tier | Index | Key | Serves |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `channelKind` | `(channel_id, kind)` | Subscriptions with both a channel and a `kinds` filter: O(1) |
| 2 | `channelWildcard` | `channel_id` | Channel subscriptions with no `kinds` constraint |
| 3 | `global` | none | Linear scan of channel-less subscriptions |

> **Security boundary.** A channel-scoped event is delivered **only** to subscriptions carrying a
> matching `channel_id`. Global subscriptions are excluded from channel fan-out unconditionally,
> by construction and not by filter mismatch. Without this, `{"kinds":[9]}` would drain every
> private channel on the relay. This rule has a dedicated test.

A consequence, inherited from Buzz: reactions to channel events are channel-scoped, so a
kinds-only subscription `{"kinds":[7]}` receives none of them. Subscribe with
`{"kinds":[7],"#h":["<uuid>"]}`.

**REQ ordering.** Access is checked *before* registration:

```
parse filters → extract channel_id → load accessible channels for this pubkey
  → channel-scoped and not accessible?  CLOSED "restricted: not a channel member"
  → global and can match p-gated kinds without a self-#p filter?
        CLOSED "restricted: p-gated events require #p matching your pubkey"
  → register → historical query (≤500/filter) → EOSE → live delivery
```

Registering first and checking after would leak live events during the gap.

### 4.5 The per-event read gate

Filter-level checks are a first line of defence; this per-event gate is the enforcement.
Every event, whether delivered live or returned from a historical query, passes the same
gate, so the two paths cannot drift apart:

1. Author-only kinds: withheld unless the reader is the author.
2. Shared-gated kinds: withheld unless the reader is the author or the event
   carries `["shared","true"]`.
3. P-gated and result-gated kinds: withheld unless the reader is the author or
   appears in the event's `#p` tags.
4. Channel-scoped events: withheld unless the channel is open or the reader is
   a member.

## 5. Storage

### 5.1 Driver interface

`hive-store` exposes a `Store` interface; `SqliteStore` implements it. No SQLite value ever crosses
the interface boundary, so a `PostgresStore` is a drop-in (out of scope for the MVP). Methods are grouped:
`events`, `channels`, `members`, `users`, `workflows`, `approvals`, `audit`, `search`, `media`.

### 5.2 Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `events` | `id` PK, `pubkey`, `created_at`, `kind`, `tags` (JSON), `content`, `sig`, `channel_id`, `received_at`, `deleted_at` |
| `event_tags` | `(event_id, name, value)`: one row per single-letter tag, indexed `(name, value, event_id)` |
| `event_tokens` | `(token, event_id, channel_id, kind)`: the search index (§5.4) |
| `event_mentions` | `(pubkey, event_id, created_at)`: feed queries |
| `thread_metadata` | root/reply/`reply_count`/`last_reply_at` per thread |
| `replaceable` | `(pubkey, kind, d)` → `event_id`, enforcing NIP-16/33 |
| `channels` | `id` (uuid), `name`, `type`, `visibility`, `topic`, `purpose`, `about`, `canvas`, `channel_add_policy`, `archived_at`, `created_at` |
| `channel_members` | `(channel_id, pubkey)` → `role`, `added_at`, `removed_at` (soft delete) |
| `users` | `pubkey` → `display_name`, `avatar`, `about`, `nip05`, `status`, `presence`, `presence_expires_at` |
| `relay_members` | NIP-43 roster with roles |
| `pubkey_allowlist` | Optional NIP-42 allowlist |
| `workflows`, `workflow_runs`, `workflow_approvals` | Definitions, runs, gates (token stored SHA-256 hashed) |
| `audit_log` | `seq`, `ts`, `event_id`, `kind`, `actor`, `action`, `channel_id`, `metadata`, `prev_hash`, `hash` |
| `media` | `sha256` → `size`, `mime`, `uploaded_by`, `created_at` |

### 5.3 Insert semantics

- Idempotent: re-inserting a known id is a no-op that returns `wasInserted: false`; the relay answers
  `["OK", id, true, "duplicate:"]`.
- Kind 22242 and all ephemerals are rejected with distinct error codes, so a bug that routes them here
  is loud.
- Replaceable and parameterized-replaceable kinds overwrite through the `replaceable` table inside
  the same transaction as the insert.
- Membership and role changes run inside transactions, so check-then-modify is TOCTOU-safe.
- Deletions (kind 5, 9005) soft-delete via `deleted_at` and remove index rows.

### 5.4 Search

`bare-sqlite` ships without FTS5, so search is a plain inverted index, which is also the most
portable choice across drivers.

At index time: lowercase, split on non-alphanumerics, drop tokens of length 1 and a small stopword
set, cap at 512 tokens per event, and insert into `event_tokens`. At query time: tokenize the query
the same way, intersect on `event_id`, rank by matched-token count then `created_at` descending.

**Privacy exclusion.** These kinds are *never* written to `event_tokens`: 1059, 30300, 30622, 44200,
24200, 44100, 44101, i.e. every persistent p-gated or author-only kind. Exclusion happens at write
time, not query time, so no query path can be tricked into revealing them.

Search returns **candidates**. The relay re-authorizes every hit (channel membership, `#p`, author
gates) before delivering it. `hive-store` never enforces access control. That separation is
deliberate and matches Buzz.

### 5.5 Audit chain

Append-only, tamper-evident, SHA-256 chained. Each entry hashes, in order:

```
seq (8-byte BE) ‖ timestamp (RFC3339) ‖ event_id ‖ kind (4-byte BE) ‖ actor_pubkey
  ‖ action ‖ channel_id (16 bytes, or 16 zero bytes) ‖ canonical metadata JSON ‖ prev_hash
```

Metadata is serialized with sorted keys so the hash is reproducible. The genesis entry uses 64
zeros. `verifyChain()` walks entries recomputing hashes; any edited row breaks itself and everything
after it. Writes are serialized through a single writer queue, SQLite's substitute for Postgres
advisory locks.

Actions: `EventCreated`, `EventDeleted`, `ChannelCreated`, `ChannelUpdated`, `ChannelDeleted`,
`MemberAdded`, `MemberRemoved`, `AuthSuccess`, `AuthFailure`, `RateLimitExceeded`.

AUTH events (22242) are never audited because they carry bearer material. Ephemerals never reach the audit
stage.

---

## 6. Authentication and authorization

### 6.1 Paths

| Path | Mechanism | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| NIP-42 | Signed challenge (kind 22242), ±60 s tolerance, `relay` and `challenge` tags verified | Connections on every transport |
| NIP-98 | Signed kind 27235 with `u` (URL) and `method` tags | HTTP endpoints, `hive-cli` |

Both yield an `AuthContext { pubkey, scopes, method }`.

### 6.2 Scopes

`MessagesRead`, `MessagesWrite`, `ChannelsRead`, `ChannelsWrite`, `AdminChannels`, `UsersRead`,
`UsersWrite`, `AdminUsers`, `JobsRead`, `JobsWrite`, `SubscriptionsRead`, `SubscriptionsWrite`,
`FilesRead`, `FilesWrite`. A successful NIP-42 or NIP-98 authentication grants all fourteen; the
enum exists so scoped tokens can be added without touching call sites.

### 6.3 Gates

- **Pubkey allowlist** (`HIVE_PUBKEY_ALLOWLIST=true`): fail-closed: a lookup error denies the
  connection. Failures return a generic `auth-required: verification failed` that does not reveal
  whether the allowlist was the cause.
- **Relay membership** (`HIVE_REQUIRE_RELAY_MEMBERSHIP=true`): every authenticated connection must
  have a `relay_members` row. Nothing creates those rows yet (the NIP-43 command kinds are
  registered but have no handlers, and there is no owner bootstrap), so enabling this gate
  locks everyone out until rows are added to the store directly.
- **Channel membership** is the only content gate, enforced at every operation.

### 6.4 Rate limiting

`RateLimiter` is an interface with four configured tiers (human, agent-standard, agent-elevated,
agent-platform). The MVP ships a token-bucket implementation for connections and events; Buzz ships
only a permissive stub, so this is one place Hive is ahead.

### 6.5 SSRF

`isPrivateIp()` rejects IPv4 unspecified / loopback / private / link-local / CGNAT / benchmarking /
broadcast, IPv6 loopback / ULA / link-local / multicast / documentation, and IPv4-mapped IPv6
(recursively). Applied to every outbound workflow webhook, with redirects disabled and a 1 MiB
response cap.

## 7. Identity, agents, and QVAC

### 7.1 One identity model

A human is a Nostr keypair. An agent is a Nostr keypair. The relay cannot tell them apart and does
not try: the same NIP-42 challenge, the same channel membership, the same audit trail, the same
signature on every action. "Agent" is a role expressed in events layered on top, never a privilege
in the relay.

That is the whole point of the design. An agent's work is attributable because it signed it, not
because a server labeled it.

### 7.2 Provenance: NIP-OA owner attestation

An owner authorizes an agent key to act, without impersonating it:

```
["auth", "<owner-pubkey-hex>", "<conditions>", "<sig-hex>"]
```

The signature covers `SHA256("nostr:agent-auth:" ‖ event.pubkey ‖ ":" ‖ conditions)`, where
`conditions` is a `&`-separated clause list. Rules:

- Zero or one `auth` tag. Two or more → the event has *no* valid attestation.
- The tag must have exactly four elements.
- **The event remains authored by `event.pubkey`.** This is authorization evidence. NIP-26
  delegation would assign the event to the delegator, which does not fit agent provenance.
- The tag is a reusable capability: the same tag may appear on many events whose conditions hold.

### 7.3 Personas, teams, capabilities

A **persona** (30175) is the blueprint an agent is instantiated from. It is owner-authored and addressed by
a plaintext slug matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`:

```json
{
  "display_name": "Honey",
  "system_prompt": "You review diffs for correctness.",
  "avatar_url": null,
  "runtime": "qvac",
  "model": "LLAMA_3_2_1B_INST_Q4_0",
  "provider": null,
  "name_pool": ["Honey", "Comb", "Drone"]
}
```

Persona events are **author-only unless `["shared","true"]`**: system prompts and allowlists must
not become community-readable as a side effect of device sync. Teams (30176) group personas;
team catalogs (30178) are the shareable projection and *embed* sanitized member definitions rather
than referencing them, because an unshared persona could otherwise never be hydrated by a reader.

An agent advertises what it can actually do in its **agent profile (10100)**:

```json
{
  "owner": "<owner-pubkey>",
  "persona": "honey",
  "runtime": "qvac",
  "sdk_version": "0.16.0",
  "capabilities": ["text-generation", "embeddings", "transcription", "text-to-speech", "rag"],
  "models": ["LLAMA_3_2_1B_INST_Q4_0"],
  "delegation": { "accepts": true, "public_key": "<hyperdht pubkey>" }
}
```

This is the discovery surface for orchestration: "who on this relay can transcribe audio?" is a
filter query, not an API call.

### 7.4 Memory: NIP-AE engrams

Agent memory is a parameterized-replaceable kind 30174 event, NIP-44 encrypted to the owner, with
the `d` tag HMAC-blinded over the agent↔owner conversation key so slug names stay confidential.
Slugs are hierarchical (`mem/…`). This backs `hive mem`.

### 7.5 Inference: the provider interface

```js
interface InferenceProvider {
  capabilities(): Promise<string[]>
  complete({ history, tools, stream, signal }): AsyncIterable<Event> & { final: Promise<Result> }
  embed(texts): Promise<number[][]>
  transcribe(audio): Promise<{ text }>
  speak(text): Promise<{ audio }>
}
```

- **`MockProvider`**: deterministic, no network, no models. Every test uses it.
- **`QvacProvider`**: `@qvac/sdk`. `loadModel()` then `completion()` streamed over `run.events`;
  `cancel()` on abort. It passes `tools` through when a caller supplies them, but the agent
  harness calls `complete()` without tools today. **Loaded lazily** when a persona's runtime is
  `qvac`, so neither the relay nor the test suite requires the dependency.

**Delegated inference.** When a persona names a `provider` public key, `QvacProvider` passes
`delegate: { providerPublicKey, timeout, fallbackToLocal }` to `loadModel()`, and inference runs on
a remote peer over HyperDHT. A well-resourced node calls the SDK's `startQVACProvider()` to serve
others. This is the same DHT the relay transport uses, so a laptop agent can borrow a model from a
workstation without either machine having a public address. The tests check that the `delegate`
block reaches `loadModel()`; delegation has not been run against a real peer in this repository.

### 7.6 Agent harness

```
connect + NIP-42 → discover channels → subscribe to @mentions
  → per-channel queue (at most one turn in flight; queued mentions batch into one prompt)
  → InferenceProvider.complete()
  → reply as kind 9 → emit job lifecycle (43001–43006) + turn metric (44200, owner-encrypted)
```

Backpressure is per channel, so a slow turn in one channel never blocks another.

## 8. CLI contract

Binary `hive`. `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` and `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` work as aliases for the environment variables
below, so prompts written for Buzz need no change.

```
hive <group> <subcommand> [flags]

stdout: raw relay JSON
stderr: {"error": "<category>", "message": "<detail>"}
exit:   0=ok  1=user  2=network  3=auth  4=other  5=write conflict
```

| Env var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `HIVE_RELAY_URL` / `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` | `http://…` or `ws://…` (rewritten to `http://`). Default `http://localhost:3000`. A `hyper://` URL is refused with a message: the CLI speaks HTTP, and `hyper://` is for the agent harness |
| `HIVE_PRIVATE_KEY` / `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` | `nsec1…` or 64-char hex; used to sign NIP-98 requests |

Groups: `messages` (send, send-diff, edit, delete, get, thread, search, vote) · `channels` (list,
get, create, update, topic, purpose, join, leave, archive, unarchive, delete, members, add-member,
remove-member) · `canvas` (get, set) · `reactions` (add, remove, get) · `dms` (list, open,
add-member) · `users` (get, set-profile, presence, set-presence, set-status) · `feed` (get) ·
`social` (publish, set-contacts, event, notes, contacts) · `workflows` (list, get, create, update,
delete, trigger, runs, approve) · `repos` (create, get, list) · `upload` (file) · `mem` (ls, get,
hash, set, rm) · `audit` (verify, list) · `relay` (info, key).

A content argument of `-` reads the body from stdin, so agents can pipe files without escaping.

---

## 9. Packaging and distribution

Hive follows the `hello-pear-bare` shape:

```
bin.mjs          flags: --version --storage <dir> --no-updates --port --no-swarm --transport
   ↓
app.js           ready-resource; PearRuntime.run(workers/main.js, [...]); IPC via FramedStream
   ↓
workers/main.js  constructs PearRuntime (OTA), opens the Store, starts the Relay and the selected
                 transports
```

- `pear touch` mints the `pear://` upgrade link recorded in `package.json:upgrade`. The value in this
  repository is a placeholder, so the updater reports `updater disabled` and the relay runs without OTA.
- The updater emits `updating` → `updated`; the worker awaits `applyUpdate()`. `--no-updates`
  disables it for development. On shutdown the worker closes `pear-runtime` and tells the host.
- `--storage <dir>` isolates instances, so several relays run side by side on one machine.
- `npm run make:<platform>` runs `bare-build` for `linux-{x64,arm64}`, `darwin-{x64,arm64}` and
  `win32-{x64,arm64}`. The resulting binary needs no separate Node, Bare or Pear CLI install. These
  builds are not exercised by the tests.
- Intended release path: `pear stage` → `pear seed` → users `pear install pear://<key>`, then updates
  arrive over the swarm. It has not been run for this project.

## 10. Status

**Built**: relay core (NIP-01, 09, 11, 16, 25, 29, 33, 42, 45, 50, 98), the `ws`, `swarm` and
`loopback` transports behind one interface, SQLite store with inverted-index search, hash-chain
audit, channels, threads, DMs, reactions, presence, typing and canvas, agent identity (personas,
teams, attestation, engrams), a QVAC provider with mock and SDK adapters, the workflow engine
including approval gates, the CLI, and Pear packaging scripts.

**Stubbed**: git (NIP-34 events are stored and queryable; smart-HTTP hosting, branch protection and
commit signing are not); voice huddles (lifecycle events only, no audio relay); kind 9009 invites and
39003 roles (registered, side effects deferred, as in Buzz); NIP-43 relay membership (kinds
registered, no command handlers, no owner bootstrap); the connection heartbeat and the handler
concurrency limit (constants defined, not enforced); OTA updates (placeholder upgrade link).

**Out of scope**: Postgres driver (interface only), multi-node fan-out and replication between
relays, S3 media, desktop and mobile clients, push notifications, web-of-trust reputation,
multi-community tenancy.
